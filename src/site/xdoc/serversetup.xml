        <section name="DavMail Setup as a server">
            <p>Prerequisite : Sun J2SE 1.5 or 1.6.
            </p>

            <p>Davmail Gateway can now run in server mode as a gateway between the mail
                client and the Outlook Web Access (Exchange) server.
                In server mode Davmail can run on any Java supported platform. This is
                currently the only way to run DavMail on MacOS X due to poor Java support
                (no Java 6 yet).
                This mode was tested successfully with the Iphone and should work with
                any phone with POP/SMTP client.
            </p>

            <p>Download the generic DavMail package from Sourceforge and uncompress it with
                your favorite tool, e.g. on Linux:<code>unzip davmail-*.zip</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Prepare a davmail.properties file according to you local needs :
            </p>
            <source>
davmail.url=http://exchangeServer/exchange/
davmail.popPort=1110
davmail.smtpPort=1025
davmail.keepDelay=30
davmail.allowRemote=true
davmail.enableProxy=false
davmail.proxyHost=
davmail.proxyPort=
davmail.proxyUser=
davmail.proxyPassword=
davmail.server=true
            </source>
            <p>See
                <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting started</a>
                for more information on
                the options. Make sure davmail.server is set to true (no icon tray) and allow
                remote connections: davmail.allowRemote=true.
            </p>
            <p>Launch Davmail with the following command:
                <source>nohup davmail.sh davmail.properties &amp;</source>.
            </p>
            <p>Then check messages:
                <source>tail -f nohup.out</source>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed with client configuration:
                <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting started</a>
            </p>
