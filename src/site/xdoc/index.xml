                        <p>Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/LDAP exchange gateway
                            allowing
                            users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or Apple iCal) with
                            an Exchange
                            server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through Outlook Web Access. DavMail now
                            includes an
                            LDAP gateway to Exchange global address book to allow recipient address completion in mail
                            compoze
                            window and full calendar support with attendees free/busy display.
                        </p>

                        <p>The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of proprietary
                            Exchange. This means LDAP for address book, SMTP to send messages, IMAP to browse messages
                            on the
                            server in any folder, POP to retrieve inbox messages only and Caldav for calendar support.
                            Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft Exchange.
                        </p>

                            DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on any platform. Releases are tested
                            on Windows,
                            Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX. Tray does not work on MacOS and is replaced with a full frame.
                            Tested successfully with the Iphone (gateway running on a server).
