        <section name="About">
            <p>Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a POP/SMTP/Caldav/LDAP exchange gateway allowing
                users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning) with an Exchange server,
                even from the internet or behind a firewall through Outlook Web Access. DavMail now includes an
                LDAP gateway to Exchange global address book to allow recipient address completion in mail compoze
                window and full calendar support with attendees free/busy display.
                DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on any platform. Releases are tested on Windows
                and Linux (Ubuntu). MacOS support is currently limited to server (headless) mode.
                Tested successfully with the Iphone (gateway running on a server).
