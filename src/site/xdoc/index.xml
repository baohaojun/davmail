                        <p>Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange
                            gateway allowing users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or
                            Apple iCal) with an Exchange server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through
                            Outlook Web Access.
                            DavMail now includes an LDAP gateway to Exchange global address book and user personal
                            contacts to allow recipient address completion in mail compose window and full calendar
                            support with attendees free/busy display.
                        </p>
                        <p>DavMail also supports the CardDav protocol to sync address books. This new feature
                            is sponsored by
                            <a href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/">French Defense / DGA</a>

                        <p>The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of proprietary
                            Exchange. This means LDAP for globale address book, SMTP to send messages, IMAP to browse
                            messages on the server in any folder, POP to retrieve inbox messages only, Caldav for
                            calendar support and Carddav for personal contacts sync.
                            Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft Exchange.
                        </p>
                        <p>DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on any platform. Releases are tested
                            on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX. Tested successfully with the Iphone
                            (gateway running on a server).
