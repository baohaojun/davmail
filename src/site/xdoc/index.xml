        <section name="About">
            <p>Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a POP/SMTP exchange gateway allowing
                users to use any mail client (e.g. Thunderbird) with an Exchange server, even from the internet
                through Outlook Web Access. DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on
                any platform. Releases are tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu). MacOS support is currently
                limited to server (headless) mode. Tested successfully with the Iphone (gateway running on a
                server).
