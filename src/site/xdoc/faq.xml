                    <strong>How do I create a WIRE debug log ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>In DavMail trackers and forums, I often ask for a WIRE debug log. To create this
                    log file, you will need to change DavMail settings under the Logging tab.
                    Set the WIRE logging category to DEBUG level.
                </p>
                <p>You can then reproduce your issue and send the log file to
                    <a href="mailto:mguessan@free.fr">mguessan@free.fr</a>
                </p>
                <p>The davmail.log file is available in DavMail working directory on Unix and Windows,
                    ~/Library/Logs/DavMail/davmail.log on OSX. This default path can be customized with
                    the
                    <code>Log File Path</code>
                    setting.

                    <strong>EWS endpoint not available</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this probably means your Exchange administrators blocked EWS access.</p>
                <p>To check this, try to connect to
                    <code>https://<i>mail.company.com</i>/ews/exchange.asmx
                    </code>
                    in your favorite web browser: you should get an authentication popup. On authentication success,
                    you should get the EWS wsdl definition. If you don't, please contact the Exchange administrators
                    to let them fix the broken Exchange server setup.
                </p>
                <p>Note: Microsoft Outlook 2011 on OSX and native OSX applications also rely on EWS to connect to
                    Exchange. Mobile devices (Android phones, iPhones, Windows mobile) use ActiveSync on a different
                    endpoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Authentication fails with invalid user or password message</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Authentication fails with the following message:
                    <code>Authentication failed: invalid user or password, retry with domain\user</code>
                </p>
                <p>Exchange before 2007 expects domain qualified user name, you may not have
                    to provide the domain name on the logon form if javascript is used to add it,
                    but DavMail can not execute javascript. Thus you need to prefix your user name
                    with the Active Directory domain followed by \
                </p>
                <p>Note to Mac users: OSX applications do not like username with backslash, you have to set windows
                    domain name in DavMail advanced settings and use the simple username in client application.
                </p>

                    <strong>Authentication fails with error in parsing the status line</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Authentication fails with the following message:
                    <code>error in parsing the status line from the response: unable to find line starting with "HTTP"
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Your Exchange server expects HTTPS (secured) connections, use https instead of http in
                    OWA url.

                    <strong>Where can I find DavMail settings file ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The default location for DavMail settings is a file named .davmail.properties in user home
                    folder. This file is hidden under Linux and OSX. On windows, the user home folder is under
                    <code>Document and Settings</code>

                    <strong>How to run multiple instances of DavMail ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Just create multiple configuration files and provide them as a command line option, see previous
                    question:

                <p>
                    <strong>What are the prerequisites on Exchange server side ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>With Exchange 2003, you only need to have access to OWA (Outlook Web Access), Webdav, Address Book
                    and public folders are always available. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Exchange 2007.
                    You must make sure Webdav support is enabled on your server. You can test this by accessing
                    https://mail.company.com/exchange, which should redirect to /owa. Another important service is the
                    galfind (address book) access at /public/?Cmd=galfind
                </p>
                <p>Additional information for Exchange administrators to enable WebDav:</p>
                <p>After running through the pre-requisite checker for each server (Front End CAS server and
                    Back End Mailbox server) and adding the appropriate roles and features, add the following
                    via the ServerManager:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select the IIS role, then add Role Services</li>
                    <li>Add WebDav Publishing (both Cas server and Mailbox Server)</li>
                    <li>On the Mailbox server, add the ISAPI extensions Role Service to the IIS role</li>
                    <li>On the Default Web Site (each server), enable WebDav</li>
                    <li>Should not have to enable any additional WebDav rules</li>
                    <li>Install the server roles</li>
                    <li>Create a test mailbox (see Exchange Docs)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To Test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that Outlook Web Access works by using the https://<i>exchangeServer</i>/owa URL
                    </li>
                    <li>Try using the pass through legacy URL: https://<i>exchangeServer</i>/exchange,
                        if you receive an error 500 “Internal Server Error”, then WebDav is not working.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Is Exchange 2010 supported ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>As Microsoft decided to drop WebDav support in Exchange 2010, I had to implement a new backend from
                    scratch to support the new Exchange Web Services interface. This support is still experimental,
                    but is working quite well. However, you still need to enable it manually in .davmail.properties
                    with the following line:
                    <br/>
                    <source>davmail.enableEws=true</source>
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Is DavMail based on Outlook protocol ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Outlook anywhere uses MAPI RPC over HTTPS to access company LAN through the firewall.
                    DavMail does not use MAPI at all but relies on WebDav (Exchange 2003/2007) or EWS (Exchange
                    2007/2010) to access Exchange. This means you need direct access over HTTPS to either the OWA WebDav
                    url (/exchange/mail@company.com) or EWS (/ews/exchange.asmx) to access Exchange with DavMail.

                    <strong>How do I secure DavMail connections ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Communication between DavMail and your Exchange server is secured by default as long as you access
                    OWA over HTTPS.
                </p>
                <p>Communication between the messaging client and DavMail is
                    <em>not</em>
                    secured by default. This is not an issue in standalone mode as all communication is local, but you
                    may want to improve this in server (shared) mode.
                </p>
                <p>This is quite simple: you just need to get a server certificate in PKCS12 or JKS format and add it in
                    the key store section in DavMail settings, see&#x20;<a href="sslsetup.html">SSL Setup</a>.

                </p>
                <p>DavMail does not store Exchange username or password, they are provided by the messaging client over
                    IMAP, HTTP, POP, SMTP or LDAP

                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Lightning does not provide much feedback of what is going
                    on. To detect errors at this level, you may activate calendar log settings

                <p>To fix the problem in OSX Mail, go to your account setup under preferences.
                    On the IMAP account having difficulty, go to the advanced tab. Where it says
                    "keep copies for offline viewing", change it to "only messages I've read" or
