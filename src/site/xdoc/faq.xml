                <p>Authentication fails with the following message:
                    <code>Authentication failed: invalid user or password, retry with domain\user</code>
                </p>
                <p>Exchange before 2007 expects domain qualified user name, you may not have
                    to provide the domain name on the logon form if javascript is used to add it,
                    but DavMail can not execute javascript. Thus you need to prefix your user name
                    with the Active Directory domain followed by \

                    <strong>How do I detect errors in Thunderbird/Lightning calendar ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Lightning does not provide much feedback of what is going
                    on. To detect errors at this level, you may activate calendar log settings
                    under Tools/Options/Advanced:
                </p>
                <source>
calendar.debug.log=true
calendar.debug.log.verbose=true
                </source>
