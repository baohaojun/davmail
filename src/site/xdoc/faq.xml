                <p>Authentication fails with the following message:
                    <code>Authentication failed: invalid user or password, retry with domain\user</code>
                </p>
                <p>Exchange before 2007 expects domain qualified user name, you may not have
                    to provide the domain name on the logon form if javascript is used to add it,
                    but DavMail can not execute javascript. Thus you need to prefix your user name
                    with the Active Directory domain followed by \

                <p>Authentication fails with the following message:
                    <code>error in parsing the status line from the response: unable to find line starting with "HTTP"
                    </code>

                <p>Your Exchange server expects HTTPS (secured) connections, use https instead of http in
                    OWA url.

                    <strong>How do I detect errors in Thunderbird/Lightning calendar ?</strong>

                <p>Unfortunately, Lightning does not provide much feedback of what is going
                    on. To detect errors at this level, you may activate calendar log settings
                    under Tools/Options/Advanced:
                </p>
                <source>calendar.debug.log=true
                    calendar.debug.log.verbose=true

                    Caldav notifications to outbox instead:

                    <strong>How to build DavMail ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Building DavMail is quite simple:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you have Java 6 installed and set as current version by checking
                        JAVA_HOME:<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unix/OSX: <source>echo $JAVA_HOME</source></li>
                            <li>Windows: <source>echo %JAVA_HOME%</source></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Download and unzip ant from<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a>,
                        add ant/bin full path to the PATH environment variable
                    </li>
                    <li>Get DavMail source package from sourceforge and uncompress it:
                        <source>tar xvzf davmail-src-*.tgz</source>
                        or checkout trunk:
                        <source>svn co http://davmail.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/davmail/trunk</source>
                    </li>
                    <li>Go into davmail directory root directory (which contains the build.xml file) and
                        type:
                        <source>ant</source>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Packages are then available under dist
                </p>
